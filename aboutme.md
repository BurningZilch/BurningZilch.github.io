My name is Ash AKA 毕真. Currently doing uni with cyber security. I enjoy video games, from YuGiOh to Dota2, from Baba is you to Florence... Sometimes I read a book, if the book finds me. 

### My story

I born in China, got my first PC when I was young, liked and still like the content I can find on internet. I do like exploring, that is why I came to Australia and as for now, I do enjoy my life as an international student.
