My name is Ash AKA 毕真. Just graduated from university with cyber security. I have passion and dream of being a engineer-like job, in terms of creating and making things functional. I enjoy video games, from YuGiOh to Dota2, from Baba is you to Florence... I also enjoy reading random topic I found interesting online and explore it.

### My story

I was born in China, got my first PC when I was young, liked and still like the content I can find on internet. I do like exploring, that is why I came to Australia for my university and high school(kind of, I only had 1.5 year). As for now, I am looking forward to get a job and meet more people at work.
